The use of track-length flux estimate can be forced in place of the collision estimator using:
set tle <n>
where <n> is the option (1 = use tle, 0 = use cfe)
If the track-length estimator is used, delta-tracking is switched off.
To reduce the demand, the
calculation can be switched off using:

cross sections on-the-fly)
Calculation of fission product poison cross section (production of I-135, Xe-135, Pm-149

set poi "<opt>"
where <opt> is the option (0 = off, 1 = on)
Calculation is off by default. Switching the mode on requires setting the file path for fission
yield data (see Sec. 8.4.1). This feature is available from version 1.1.17 on.

-----Detectors----
The syntax is relatively simple:
det <name> <param 1> <param 2> ...
where <name> is the detector name
<param 1> <param 2> ... are the detector parameter sets

dr Reaction multiplier Determines the response function
dv Detector volume Used for normalization
dc Detector cell Defines the cell where the reactions are scored
du Detector universe Defines the universe where the reactions are scored
dm Detector material Defines the material where the reactions are scored
dl Detector lattice Defines the lattice where the reactions are scored
de Detector energy grid Defines the energy bins for the response function
dx Detector mesh Defines the x-mesh where the reactions are scored
dy Detector mesh Defines the y-mesh where the reactions are scored
dz Detector mesh Defines the z-mesh where the reactions are scored
dt Detector type Special detector types
ds Surface current detector Defines surface for current detector
The detector response function is defined by the “dr” entry:
det <name> dr <mt> <mat>
where <name> is the detector name
<mt> is the response function number
<mat> is the material name (or “void” for void material)
Material total reactions 0 None
-1 Total
-2 Total capture
-3 Total elastic
-5 Total (n,2n)
-6 Total fission

51 Inelastic scattering to 1st excited state
52 Inelastic scattering to 2nd excited state

det <name> de <ene>
where <name> is the detector name
<ene> is the grid name
The same energy grid definition is also used with B1 fundamental mode calculation (See
Sec. 5.16).
The number of energy bins is defined by the grid size. There are four types of energy grids
1. arbitrarily defined
2. equal energy-width bins
3. equal lethargy-width bins
4. predefined energy group structure
The grid definition has three entry formats:
ene <name> 1 <E1> <E2> ... <En>
ene <name> <type> <N> <Emin> <Emax>
ene <name> 4 <struct>
where <name> is the grid name
<type> is the grid type
<E1> <E2> ... <En> are the bin boundaries in type 1 grid
<N> is the number of bins in type 2 and 3 grids
<Emin> is the minimum energy in type 2 and 3 grids
<Emax> is the maximum energy in type 2 and 3 grids
<struct> is the name of a predefined structure
The detector energy grid is often used for calculating spectral quantities. There are three
special detector types for spectral calculations, determined by the “dt” detector type entry:
1. Cumulative spectrum (“dt -1”)
2. Division by energy width (“dt -2”)
3. Division by lethargy width (“dt -3”)

There are five options for setting the spatial domain of the integration
1. By defining the cell where the reaction rates are scored using the “dc” parameter.
2. By defining the universe where the reaction rates are scored using the “du” parameter.
3. By defining the material where the reaction rates are scored using the “dm” parameter.
4. By defining the lattice where the reaction rates are scored using the “dl” parameter.
5. By setting up a one-, two- or three-dimensional mesh using the “dx”, “dy” and “dz”
parameters.

Detector cells, materials and universes
Detector cell, material and universe parameters all work on the same principle: the collision
is scored if it occurs inside the cell, material or universe, respectively. A separate bin is
created for each entry and the combination of different types creates a combination of bins.
The syntax is:
det <name> dc <cell> dm <mat> du <univ>
where <name> is the detector name
<cell> is the detector cell
<mat> is the detector material
<univ> is the detector universe
The cells in fuel pins are named using convention:
nst<np>c<nr>
where <np> is the pin (universe) number
<nr> is the ring index starting from the innermost region (= 1)
Burnable materials in fuel pins are renamed and divided into a user-defined number of annular
depletion zones (see Sec. 8.2 on page 109). The naming convention is:
<mat>p<np>r<nr>
where <mat> is the original material name
<np> is the pin (universe) number
<nr> is the ring index starting from the innermost region (= 1)
The input format for the lattice detector is:
det <name> dl <lat>
where <name> is the detector name
<lat> is the detector lattice number
The mesh detector creates a super-imposed uniform square mesh over the geometry. The
mesh structure is given separately in x-, y- and z-directions and the input format for the
x-type is:
det <name> dx <xmin> <xmax> <nx>
where <name> is the detector name
<xmin> is the minimum x-coordinate of the mesh
<xmax> is the maximum x-coordinate of the mesh
<nx> is the number of mesh bins in the x-direction
The syntax for the current detector is:
det <name> ds <surf> <dir>
where <name> is the detector name
<surf> is the surface name
<dir> is the direction vector (-1 = inward, 0 = net, 1 = outward)


-----Depleted Materials----
Depleted materials are identified by an additional “burn” entry in the material card:
mat <name> <dens> burn <nr>
<iso 1> <frac 1>
<iso 2> <frac 2>
...
where <name> is the material name
<dens> is the density (mass or atomic)
<nr> is the number of annular regions in depleted
fuel pins
<iso 1> <iso 2> ... are the names of the constituent nuclides
<frac 1> <frac 2> ... are the corresponding fractions (mass or atomic)
The code automatically renames the depleted pin materials using convention:
<mat>p<np>r<nr>
where <mat> is the original material name
<np> is the pin (universe) number
<nr> is the ring index starting from the innermost region (= 1)
Depleted materials in ordinary cells are not renamed or divided into sub-regions.

-----Irradiation History----
The irradiation history in the independent burnup calculation mode consists of one or several
burnup intervals, defined by the “dep” card:
dep <stype>
<step 1>
<step 2>
...
where <stype> is the step type
<step 1> <step 2> ... are the burnup steps
<stype> Step values
bustep depletion step, burnup intervals given in MWd/kgU
butot depletion step, cumulative burnup given in MWd/kgU
daystep depletion step, time intervals given in days
daytot depletion step, cumulative time given days
decstep decay step, time intervals given in days
dectot decay step, cumulative time given in days

set declib "<file>"
where <file> is the file path for the ENDF format decay data library
the neutron-induced fission yield library using:
set nfylib "<file>"
where <file> is the file path for the ENDF format fission yield library
and the spontaneous fission yield library:
set sfylib "<file>"
where <file> is the file path for the ENDF format fission yield library
set bunorm <mode>
where <mode> is the normalization mode
Mode 1 is the default treatment which normalizes the given reaction rate or power to all
materials. Mode 2 includes only burnable materials and mode 3 only non-burnable materials.
The option is available from update 1.1.5 on and earlier code versions use all materials in the
normalization.
The code automatically calculates the total fissile mass in the system, which is needed for
normalizing the reaction rates. If the calculation fails, the value can be set manually using:
set fmass <m>
where <m> is the total fissile mass in the system (in grams)
The calculation mode is set using:
set bumode <mode>
where <mode> is the method used for depletion calculation
The first method (<mode> = 1) is Transmutation Trajectory Analysis (TTA), based on the
analytical solution of linearized transmutation chains. The second method (<mode> = 2),
used by default, is an advanced matrix exponential solution based on the Chebyshev Rational
Approximation Method (CRAM). The third option (<mode> = 3) is the variation TTA
method, in which cyclic transmutation chains are handled by inducing small variations in the
coefficients instead of solving the extended TTA equations.
Predictor-corrector calculation is activated using:
set pcc <corr>
where <corr> is the flag for running the corrector step (0 = no, 1 = yes)
There are two options for calculating the isotopic one-group transmutation cross sections:
set xscalc <mode>
where <mode> is the method used for cross section calculation
In the default method (<mode> = 2), the code calculates these parameters using a highresolution
flux spectrum recorded during the transport calculation. This procedure results in
a reduction of calculation time by a factor of 3-4 compared to the direct calculation of the
cross sections during the transport cycle (<mode> = 1). The drawback is that the method is
an approximation and that the information on statistical accuracy is lost.2
The selection is based on the cumulative yield of each fp mass chain:
set fpcut <lim>
where <lim> is the limit for fission product yield cut-off
By default, the range of actinide mass chains included in the calculation extends from Amin -
1 to Amax + 7, where Amin and Amax are the minimum and maximum actinide mass numbers
in the initial composition. This range can be set manually by:
set axs <Amin> <Amax>
where <Amin> is the lightest actinide mass chain included in the calculation
<Amax> is the heaviest actinide mass chain included in the calculation
Stability cut-off:
set stabcut <lim>
where <lim> is the limit for stability cut-off
TTA chain cut-off:
set ttacut <lim>
where <lim> is the limit for TTA chain cut-off
Cross section fraction cut-off:
set xsfcut <lim>
where <lim> is the limit for cross section fraction chain cut-off
Threshold energy cut-off:
set xsecut <lim>
where <lim> is the energy boundary
set by the inventory option:
set inventory <id1> <id2> ...
where <idn> are the identifiers.
The list consists of numerical values that identify the nuclides (1000*Z + 10*A + I) or elements
(Z). Isotope and and elemental names and symbols (“Pu-239”, “Gd155”, “PM148M”,
“Cs”, “plutonium”, etc.) are also accepted. Elemental values are calculated by summing
over the isotopes. Table 8.3 lists additional options that can be used in the inventory list to
sum over several elements.
201 act Actinides (Z > 89)
202 fp Fission products
204 dp Decay products below thorium in the natural actinide decay series
208 ng Noble gases (in the fission product range, helium and radon excluded)

set printm <mode>
where <mode> is the flag for printing material compositions (0 = no, 1 = yes)
The code produces for each step a file named “<input>.bumat<n>”, where <input>
is the name of the input file and <n> is the burnup step. The material compositions can be
used in another Serpent calculation or converted to MCNP format for validation purposes.

Decay heat production can be divided into multiple precursor groups based on the nuclide
decay constant. The syntax for the option is:
set dhprec [ <l0> <l1> ... ]
where <ln> are the group boundaries in ascending order


-----External Source Mode----
The calculation mode is activated by replacing the “pop” input
parameter (see Sec. 5.2 on page 53) with:
set nps <Nsrc> [ <Nbatch> ]
where <Nsrc> is the total number of source neutrons run
<Nbatch> is the number of batches run
By default, the simulation is run by dividing the source size into 200 batches. Apart from the
source definition, described in the following section, the external source simulation works
very similar to the criticality source method. All features, including detectors and burnup
calculation are available.
The syntax for the source definition is:
src <name> <param 1> <param 2> ...
where <name> is the source name
<param 1> <param 2> ... are the source parameter sets
sw Source weight Determines the relative importance of the source
sc Source cell Defines the cell where the neutrons are started
sm Source material Defines the material where the neutrons are started
sp Source point Defines the coordinates of a point source
sx, sy, sz Source boundaries Defines the boundaries of the source distribution
sd Source direction Defines the source direction vector
se Source energy Multiple uses
sb Source energy bins Defines a bin-wise energy spectrum
sr Source reaction Defines the source reaction
ss Source surface Defines a surface source

If spatial distribution is not defined, neutrons are started uniformly all over the geometry.
The sampling volume can limited by setting the boundaries in x-, y- and z-directions using:
src <name> sx <x0> <x1> sy <y0> <y1> sz <z0> <z1>
where <name> is the source name
<x0> is the minimum boundary in x-direction
<x1> is the maximum boundary in x-direction
<y0> is the minimum boundary in y-direction
<y1> is the maximum boundary in y-direction
<z0> is the minimum boundary in z-direction
<z1> is the maximum boundary in z-direction
The source can be defined by a single cell using:
src <name> sc <cell>
where <name> is the source name
<cell> is the cell where the neutrons are started
or to a single material using:
src <name> sm <mat>
where <name> is the source name
<mat> is the material where the neutrons are started
The cell and material definitions can be used in combination with the boundaries set by “sx”,
“sy” and “sz”.
An alternative to a volume source is the point source, defined as:
src <name> sp <x> <y> <z>
where <name> is the source name
<x> is x-coordinate of the point source
<y> is y-coordinate of the point source
<z> is z-coordinate of the point source

Surface sources can be defined as:
src <name> ss <surf>
where <name> is the source name
<surf> is the source surface
The surface is defined using the “surf” card (see Sec. 3.2 on page 19). Positive and negative
entries refer to neutrons being emitted in the direction of positive and negative surface normal,
respectively. The feature is available from version 1.1.15 on, and the allowed surface
types include sphere (“sph”) and cylinder (“cyl”).

Setting the Directional Distribution
By default, all source neutrons in point and volume sources are emitted isotropically. To
define a mono-directional source, the direction vector can be set by the “sd” parameter:
src <name> sd <u> <v> <w>
where <name> is the source name
<u> is direction cosine in the x-direction
<v> is direction cosine in the y-direction
<w> is direction cosine in the z-direction

Setting the Energy Distribution
A mono-energetic source is defined by setting the “se” parameter:
src <name> se <E>
where <name> is the source name
<E> is neutron energy
By default, the emission energy is set to 1 MeV.
Another option is to take the energy distribution from a nuclear reaction using the “sr” option:
src <name> sr <iso> <mt>
where <iso> is the nuclide identifier
<mt> is the reaction mt

The third option is to define discrete energy bins as:
src <name> sb <nb> <E0> <w0> <E1> <w1> ... <En> <wn>
where <nb> is the number of source energy bins
<Ei> are the energy bin boundaries
<wi> are the bin weights

Source distribution can be read from a file using:
src <name> sf <file> <type>
where <name> is the source name
<file> is the source file
<type> is the file type (must be 1)
The source file contains coordinates, direction cosines, energy, weight and time for every
source neutron, one entry per line.

-----Mesh Plotter----
Mesh input
Serpent has a built-in capability to visualize the neutronics in thermal systems by plotting
the fission power and thermal flux distributions in a single png graphics file. The parameters
for a reaction rate mesh plotter are defined as:
mesh <or> <nx> <ny> [ <sym> <x0> <x1> <y0> <y1> <z0> <z1> ]
where <or> is the orientation of the plot plane (1, 2 or 3)
<nx> is the width of the plot in pixels
<ny> is the height of the plot in pixels
<sym> is the symmetry option (0, 2, 4 or 8)
<x0> is the minimum value of the x-coordinate
<x1> is the maximum value of the x-coordinate
<y0> is the minimum value of the y-coordinate
<y1> is the maximum value of the y-coordinate
<z0> is the minimum value of the z-coordinate
<z1> is the maximum value of the z-coordinate
The code calculates reaction rates in an <nx>by <ny> mesh, and projects tha data according
to the orientation of the plot plane, defined as:
1. yz-plot (perpendicular to the x-axis)
2. xz-plot (perpendicular to the y-axis)
3. xy-plot (perpendicular to the z-axis)
